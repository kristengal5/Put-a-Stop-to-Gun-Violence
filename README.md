# Put-a-Stop-to-Gun-Violence
I created this in my Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program summer 2022. 
I created wireframes with Adobe XD, researched information about the cause, and coded this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I included features like a text generator and fact generator. 
Then, I presented this website to BlackRock employees. 
I was tasked with creating a capstone website about any activism topic, and I chose to create a website about gun violence.
